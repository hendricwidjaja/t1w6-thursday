## Control Flow
Order in which lines of code are executed in a program.

# Sequential control flow
Execution of code statements one after another, in the order they appear in the program

# Conditional Control Flow / Control Flow
Execution of code statements based on some input

if tomorrow is Saturday
    set alarm for 7
if tomorrow is Tuesday
    set alarm for 6

# Boolean Data Type Re-visit
Data type that has two values: True and False. Boolean values are used to control the flow of the program

# Comparison Operators / Relational Operators
Decide the relationship between the operands. Result of comparison is a boolean value (True/False)

if tomorrow == Saturday:
    set alarm for 7
if tomorrow == Tuesday:
    set alarm for 6

# if, elif, else
Simplest form of AI (you could say)
'if' checks the condition, if true, the indented blocks get executed, if false, it skips the indented.

today = "Tuesday"

if today == "Monday":
    print ("Set alarm for 5am")
if today == "Tuesday":
    print ("Set alarm for 6am")
if today == "Saturday":
    print("Set alarm for 7am")

# Pass
Does nothing, just ... passes ... for now (placeholder)

# Boolean Operaters
AND, OR, NOT. Operands need to be boolean as well.
